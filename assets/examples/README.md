### Example configurations

Configuration files shown in the [preview](../images/colorful_preview.png).

They patch the `dark` theme.


### How to apply these configs

Download one of the JSON files.

Then, edit the `offset` with the right value (use the one provided by `extract-default-config`) - **check twice** to avoid to put the wrong value here.

Last, apply it using:

```bash
ncducolors apply-config ncdu_COLOR.json
```

> Note: even if these themes are for Ncdu 1.17+, NcduColors can automatically patch Ncdu >=1.7 themes to Ncdu <1.7.
